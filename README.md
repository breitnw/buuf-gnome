# buuf-gnome

A modified version of the [Buuf](https://www.pling.com/p/1012512/) icon theme for GNOME with some patched icons from [Buuf-Nestort](https://www.pling.com/p/1012233/). Patched icons include:

- Certain window icons (close, minimize, maximize, etc.)
- Most application icons
- Icons for volume, brightness, and microphone settings

I made this patched theme because Buuf-Nestort had many missing setting icons, but a much more comprehensive library of app icons.
