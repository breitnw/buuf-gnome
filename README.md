# buuf-gnome

A modified version of the [Buuf](https://www.pling.com/p/1012512/) icon theme for GNOME with some patched icons from [Buuf-Nestort](https://www.pling.com/p/1012233/). I made this theme because Buuf-Nestort had many missing setting icons, but a much more comprehensive library of app icons. Patched icons from Buuf-Nestort include:

- Most application icons
- Icons for volume, brightness, and microphone settings

Also, I've patched some of the icons manually, including:

- Certain window icons (close, minimize, maximize, etc). These icons were somewhat inconsistent, so I've changed them to the round "media icon" representations. 
- Icons that were originally off-center, including media icons and circling arrows. These just bugged me.
